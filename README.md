Pronounced /Ààk…õf…®Ãûl/ **('keff-ill')**, meaning 'horse' in Cymraeg/Welsh üè¥Û†ÅßÛ†Å¢Û†Å∑Û†Å¨Û†Å≥Û†Åøüêé 

A software package to rapidly and flexibly analyse pulsar timing array (PTA) data via refiting to pulsar timing free spectra.

This can be done by fitting to a free spectrum of the entire PTA or to individual pulsars!

## Installation

To install via `pip', simply use PyPi:
```bash
pip install ceffyl
```

## data
Download representations of PTA data to accurately fit spectral models with ceffyl!
